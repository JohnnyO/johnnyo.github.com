Before I start any new kit, I like to do some research into the subject matter.  I'm not overly obsessed with rivet counting  in my builds, but I do like to learn more about the subjects I'm working on before I tackle them.  In some cases, I find this part of the process to be just as interesting as the construction process itself.  For this kit, I'll be working on a GMC Bofors 40mm Gun, a mobile anti-aircraft system that was unique to the free French forces during World War Two.

## History

The kit name is a bit confusing because, as far as I'm aware, the weapon system doesn't have any sort of official name, like something that was produced from a factory.  That's because this system is actually the combination of two well-known pieces of machinery into something new.  The first half of this system is the [GMC CCKW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMC_CCKW), also known as the "Deuce and a Half".  This GMC truck was a workhorse of the Allied military in WWII, serving in various roles such as a supply truck or a mobile medical van.  The US produced almost half a million of these trucks throughout the war, and they were given to our allies as well, including the French.

The second piece of equipment is the [40mm Bofors Gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bofors_40_mm_gun) which was one of the most popular antiaircraft systems in World War II.  These guns were used both on ships as well as on land.  The land units were wheeled, and as such could be repositioned/towed into location when needed.   According to my research, the French were provided with a number of Bofors Gun, along with several GMC CCKWs in order tow them.  However, some enterprising French soldier/engineer decided that it would be much simpler to simply place the gun directly on the truck.  This required them to rip apart the rear of the truck and build a new mounting for the gun, but overall, its a rather ingenious idea.  And thus, the GMC Bofors 40mm gun was born.     


## Kit Details

For this build, I'll be tackling the [GMC Bofors 40mm Gun](https://www.scalemates.com/products/product.php?id=134606) from HobbyBoss.   The kit is 1:35 scale, and primarly molded in an olive green color.  In addition to the main sprues, you also a clear sprue for windows and lens covers, a sheet of photoetch, a set of decals, and even some string for making the tow rope on the front of the vehicle.
